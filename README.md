A video to audio convertor in python 3.8

## Instructions
How we convert is this way - 
Lets consider you cloned this repo . 
This is the example image - 

![Image of folder of cloned repo](https://i.ibb.co/gM5gPHb/Screenshot-2021-10-10-153102.png)

Now add a video file to the folder and rename it file.mp4

Now make sure python is correctly installed on the system and you have installed a module named moviepy. You can do that by opening a command prompt window and type ```pip install moviepy```

once it installs and insuring there are no errors open the folder of cloned repo and run main.py . After 2-5 seconds considering you have good internet and good system speed, suddenly you can see a file named file.mp3 in the folder. This is the audio file converted . There can be a difference in length of the two files of 0.5 to 1 second.

voila - you have extracted the audio from your video file

I will also release a .exe version of the application so everyobdy can use it without python installed.
